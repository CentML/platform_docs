Deploy dedicated LLM endpoints that fits your performance requirements and budget in just three steps.

## 1. Choose your LLM
Select or enter the Hugging Face model name of your choosing and provide your Hugging Face token. Also provide a name for the dedicated endpoint you are going to deploy.

<Tip>
Make sure you have been granted access to the model you selected. If not, please go to https://huggingface.co/ and request for access.

## 2. Plan and optimize
Choose the cluster or the region you want to deploy the model. Based on that, CentML presents three pre-configured deployment configurations to suit different requirements:

- **Best performance:** A configuration optimized for latency and throughput, suitable for high-demand applications where performance is critical.
- **Lowest cost:** A cost-effective configuration designed to minimize expenses, ideal for non-critical applications with lighter usage.
- **Best value:** A balanced configuration offering a mix of performance and cost efficiency, tailored to provide an ideal trade-off for general usage.

Each configuration is accompanied by detailed analysis on:

- **Time to first token:** Indicates the latency between sending a request to a language model and receiving the first piece of its response.
- **Throughput:** Measures the number of requests the model can handle per second.
- **Cost per token:** Shows the cost of generating a million tokens.

These insights help you choose the configuration that best meets your needs.

### (Optional) Performance customization
For advanced users, CentML Platform also offers an option to customize their model performance configuration. Simply click the "Custom" configuration to gain full control over several tunable parameters.

## 3. Deploy
Finally, click "Deploy". Once the deployment is ready in a few minutes, copy the endpoint url and go to `https://<endpoint_url>/docs` to find the list of API endpoints to start using your LLM deployment. We offer API compatibility with CServe, OpenAI, and Cortex, making integration with other applications seamless.
