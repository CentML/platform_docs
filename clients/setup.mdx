We provide a client library to programmatically interact with CentML Platform either through [command line](/resources/cli) or using [Python SDK](/resources/sdk).

Use the following command to install centml client.

```bash
pip install centml
```

Run the following command to login to CentML using the client credentials.

```bash
centml login
```

The first time, you'll be prompted to download the credentials from the CentML Platform console under [Accounts -> Credentials](https://app.centml.com/user/credentials).

Run the login command again with the downloaded credential file.

```bash
centml login <path_to>/credential
```

Once logged in, you are all set to use CentML client. To logout, use the following command.

```bash
centml logout
```
